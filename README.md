# foowise

Infomorphic channels ([Barwise and Seligman, 1997][blue book]) rigorously formalize what it means for data to carry meaning across time, space, and subjectivity.

The purpose this repository to is to mechanize the underlying theory, and to demonstrate a few interesting applications.

The relevant literature is somewhat obscure, and often hard to follow, and so I've begun to compile a reference in [the documentation folder][glossary].
